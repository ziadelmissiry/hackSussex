        <h2>Burning Fossil Fuels</h2>
        <p>When we burn fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas, we release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun and cause the Earth's temperature to rise.</p>

        <h2>Deforestation</h2>
        <p>Trees absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen, so when we cut down forests, we reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that can be absorbed from the atmosphere. In addition, when forests are burned or cleared, the carbon stored in the trees is released into the atmosphere.</p>

        <h2>Agriculture</h2>
        <p>Agriculture contributes to climate change in several ways. Livestock farming produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and fertilizer use produces nitrous oxide, another greenhouse gas. In addition, land use changes for agriculture, such as deforestation or the conversion of grasslands to croplands, can also release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</p>
