        <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
        <p>Climate change refers to the long-term changes in the Earth's climate, including temperature, precipitation, and wind patterns, that have occurred over the past century or more. These changes are largely caused by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</p>

        <h2>Ocean Levels and Climate Change</h2>
        <p>As the Earth's temperature rises due to climate change, the polar ice caps and glaciers are melting, causing sea levels to rise. This can lead to flooding, erosion, and loss of habitat for marine life. In addition, ocean acidification, caused by the absorption of carbon dioxide by seawater, is making it harder for some marine organisms to survive.</p>
